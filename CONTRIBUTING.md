# Contributing to wigolo

Thanks for your interest in improving wigolo. This document covers how to get set
up, how to propose changes, and the contribution terms.

## Development setup

Requires Node.js ≥ 20.

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # JS -> dist/, no type checking (~1s)
npm run build:all    # JS + declarations, type-checks the project
npm test             # full vitest suite
npm run test:unit    # unit tests only
npm run lint         # tsc --noEmit, incremental after the first run
```

`npm run dev` runs the CLI from source via `tsx`.

`npm run build` is the fast inner loop and runs **no type checker** — pair it
with `npm run lint` while iterating. `build:all` is what CI runs and what
`npm pack`/`npm publish` trigger through `prepack`, so released tarballs always
carry declarations.

## Proposing changes

1. Open an issue first for anything non-trivial so we can agree on the approach.
2. Branch from `main`, keep changes focused, and add tests for new behavior.
3. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
4. Make sure `npm test` and `npm run lint` pass before opening a PR.
5. Open a pull request describing the change and why it matters.

## Guidelines

- Prefer the smallest change that fully solves the problem.
- Match the surrounding code style. Minimal comments — only where the "why" is
  non-obvious.
- All logging goes to stderr (stdout is reserved for the MCP stdio protocol).
- Don't add dependencies without a clear need; note new deps in the PR.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By submitting a contribution (a pull request, patch, or any other work) to this
project, you agree to the following:

1. **License of your contribution.** You license your contribution to the project
   and to everyone downstream under the same license as the project

   commercial license). This lets the project offer commercial licensing
   alongside the open-source AGPL release.

3. **You have the right to grant this.** You certify that the contribution is your
   original work (or that you have the right to submit it) and that, to your
   knowledge, it does not infringe anyone else's rights.
